      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We created MindSpace because we’ve also experienced sleepless nights, cramming, and feeling burned out. We realized students need more than just study tips — they need support for their well-being.</p>
      <p>Here, we share ways to manage time, reduce stress, and stay healthy while still keeping up with schoolwork.</p>
