      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We created <strong>MindSpace</strong> because we’ve been there — sleepless nights, endless cramming, and feeling like there’s never enough time to breathe. We realized that students need more than study hacks; they need a place to slow down, reset, and feel human again.</p>

      <h3>How It All Began</h3>
      <p>It began with late-night study sessions and shared conversations about burnout. We both felt the weight of expectations and the noise of constant online pressure. So, we decided to create a digital space that does the opposite — one that invites peace, focus, and calm.</p>
      <p>MindSpace was built for students like us — to pause, to breathe, and to learn how to thrive without losing themselves in the process. Whether it’s through mindfulness tips, encouraging words, or simple relaxation, we hope this space gives you a reason to smile again.</p>
      <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
      <p>MindSpace is designed to help students restore balance between study, stress, and self-care. It provides a safe digital space where users can pause, reflect, and access tips for mindfulness, motivation, and healthy routines. Our goal is to guide students toward calm, focus, and a sustainable approach to learning and personal well-bein</p>
